# Facial-Emotion-Detection
Face detection, Recognition and Emotion detection 
# This is a project to analyses facial expressions from both static images and videos in order to reveal information on one's emotional state.

# Project Pipeline:

1. Facial Detection — detect the location of face in any input image or frame. The output is the bounding box coordinates of the detected faces
2. Facial Recognition — Compare multiple faces together to identify which faces belong to the same person. This is done by comparing face embedding vectors
3. Emotion Detection — Classifying the emotion on the face as happy, angry, sad, neutral, surprise, disgust or fear.
